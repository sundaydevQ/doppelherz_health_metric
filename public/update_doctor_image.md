# Update the Doctor Image

To fully match the design from the provided mobile screen mockup, you should replace the placeholder doctor emoji with an actual doctor illustration image.

## Required Steps:

1. Create or obtain an illustration of a doctor with purple hair in a lab coat similar to the one shown in the mockup
2. Save the image in your assets folder (e.g., `src/assets/images/doctor.png`)
3. Update the HomePage.tsx file to use this image:

```tsx
// Replace this section in HomePage.tsx
<div className="rounded-3xl w-full max-w-xs aspect-square bg-gradient-to-b from-[#8c62e3] to-[#6942af] flex items-center justify-center mb-8">
  {/* Replace the placeholder with your actual image */}
  <img
    src="/src/assets/images/doctor.png"
    alt="Doctor illustration"
    className="w-full h-full object-contain p-4"
  />
</div>
```

The current implementation uses a placeholder emoji (üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è) with a purple gradient background as a temporary solution until you can provide the actual illustration.
